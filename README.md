# Desktop Data Scraper

#### A desktop app built around my [data entry bot](https://github.com/Trevin-Small/Data-Scraper-V2) I use for work.

# This app automates data entry for Driggs Title agency.
- Enter in the date range for which you wish to complete records, and press play!
-  The software will open a new selenium controlled browser instance and complete data entry automagically.
- It keeps track of the number of "names" (records) completed, as well as names skipped.

## Built with electron, tailwind css, html, JS, nodeJS, python, and even a bit of shell.
- Truly a smorgasbord!
